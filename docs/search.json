If not, what can one do to make it more reliable?\nWhat do you expect the frequency to be if N would be a very large number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDefine the events A = “heads” and B = “six”.\nSpecify P(A) and P(B).\nCalculate P(A and B) using the multiplication rule for two independent events.\nDon’t forget to multiply by N to get the expected frequency.\n\n\nRepeat the experiment with N = 100 to verify if estimates of the expected frequencies become more reliable with a larger number of observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the prepared spreadsheet in frequency_experiment.xlsx\n\n\n\n Download xlsx file\n\n\n\nFirst you have to figure out how to expand the formulas for 100 iterations.\n\n\n\n\nChance\nNow let us go back to the step where you specified the probabilities P(A) and P(B). How did you do that? One way to do it is to look at the outcome space, find the outcomes that correspond to the event and divide by the total number of outcomes.\nFor the coin the outcome space is “heads” and “tails”, i.e. n = 2. The event of a getting “heads” can occur in one of the outcomes, i.e. m = 1. Under the assumption that all outcomes are equally likely, the theoretical probability for “heads” is \\(\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\nFor the dice, the outcome space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, i.e. n = 6. The event of getting a “six” can occur in one way, i.e. m = 1. The theoretical probability for the event “six” is therefore \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that theoretical probabilities can only be used in balanced situations such as dice, cards, or lottery tickets where it justified to assume symmetry (equal probability) for all possible outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nRelative frequency\nIf we divide the frequency of an event by the number of trials N, we get the relative frequency which is a good estimate of a probability for the event to occur at the next iteration of the same experiment.\nLet \\(m\\) be the number of times the event has occurred. \\(E(\\frac{m}{N})=\\frac{E(m)}{N}=\\frac{N\\cdot P(event)}{N} = P(event)\\)\nRelative frequencies can be used to estimate the probability for an event as long as the observations are equally likely across the full outcome space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure N is large\n\n\n\nThe more observations (i.e. larger N) the better estimate.\nThe more extreme event, i.e. very low or high probability of occurring, the more observations are needed.\nBe very skeptical to estimates of probabilities that are either 0 and 1, when the event is possible to occur.\n\n\n\n\nBelief\nTake one of the thumbtacks provided in the exercise and a cup. Put the thumbtack in the cup, shake and place the cup upside down on a table without revealing the outcome.\n\nWhat outcomes are possible?\n\nFocus on the outcome that the thumbtack is having its head down with the needle pointing upwards.\n\nLet everyone in the group state their personal probability of this event as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means that it is impossible to occur and 1 means that it is certain to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCromwell’s rule\n\n\n\nProbabilities 1 (“the event will definitely occur”) or 0 (“the event will definitely not occur”) should be avoided, except when applied to statements that are logically true or false.\n\n\n\nDiscuss if and why the probabilities differ.\n\nThis is an example of probability as a subjective probability that is purely a personal judgement based on available evidence and assumptions.\nMore evidence ought to result in smaller divergence in judgements. One way to illustrate this is to lift the cup and let everyone revise their judgement.\n\nDo that!\n\nGiven that the evidence is revealing the outcome, the subjective probabilities held by the students in the group should now be either 1 or 0.\nIn risk assessment, we seldom have such full certainty as in this example. Probabilities are almost inevitably based on judgements and assumptions such as random sampling.\n\n\nA general advice\nProbability can be thought of as an expected frequency. Instead of saying that “the probability of the event is 0.20 (or 20%)”, you can say “out of 100 situations like this, we would expect the event to occur 20 times”.\nBy carefully stating the denominator (reference class), ambiguity about the meaning of probability can be avoided.\nThis advice applies to any of the interpretations."
