Sally would probably get more marks than hi, but here was a distinct possibility that Zak would mess up. The weather forecast said it might rain, so took a coat, and as he walked to school he thought he was likely to meet Zak, who always played around, and could make him late. If he were late, he was certain to get into trouble. Perhaps there would be a fire drill to disrupt the test? But really there was little chance of that and it was also extremely unlikely an asteroid would hit the school. It was going to be a difficult sort of day.\n\nDo individually\n\nUnderline the words or phrases that express uncertainty, such as “could”, “likely” and so on.\nMake a list of these words, and rank them in terms of highest to lowest probability.\nPut each word on the vertical probability scale. For example, if you think that “almost certain” is near 50% write it next to 50%.\n\nCollect together the responses and dicuss the ranges in opinion."

    "text": "Verbal expressions for the level of evidence\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have devised a system of categories to evaluate the carcinogenicity of an agent to humans. An agent is classified based on scientific evidence derived from human and experimental animal studies and from mechanistic and other relevant data. The list of categories and their definition are as follows:\n\nTable 2. IARC classifications of carcinogenic agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nDescription\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1\nCarcinogenic to humans\nSufficient evidence of carcinogenicity OR Evidence of carcinogenicity in humans is less than sufficient but there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and strong evidence in exposed humans that the agent acts through a relevant mechanism of carcinogenicity\n\n\nGroup 2A\nProbably carcinogenic to humans*\nLimited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals OR Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and strong evidence that the carcinogenesis is mediated by a mechanism that also operates in humans OR Limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans, but belongs, based on mechanistic considerations, to a class of agents for which one or more members have been classified in Group 1 or Group 2A\n\n\nGroup 2B\nPossibly carcinogenic to humans*\nLimited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals OR Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals OR Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals, but with supporting evidence from mechanistic and other relevant data\n\n\nGroup 3\nNot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\nEvidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or limited in experimental animals OR Evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans but sufficient in experimental animals, but strong evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experimental animals does not operate in humans OR Agents that do not fall into any other group. Agents in Group 3 are not determined to be non-carcinogenic or safe overall, but often means that further research is needed.\n\n\n\n* Footnote to the table: The terms “probably carcinogenic” and “possibly carcinogenic” have no quantitative significance and are used simply as descriptors of different levels of evidence of human carcinogenicity, with probably carcinogenic signifying a higher level of evidence than possibly carcinogenic.\nDiscuss the following questions:\n\nHow do you understand the term “probably” and “possibly” in this classification system?\nIs there a difference between expressing the level of evidence and the certainty about a conclusion\nSuggest probabilities (or ranges of probabilities) corresponding to each group!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe distinction between expressing the level of evidence and the certainty about a conclusion is also refereed to as indirect and direct uncertainty see van der Bles et al. 2019. In risk assessment you will come across both these ways of expressing uncertainty. We will discuss in a later exercises how expert judgements or modelling can be used to consider indirect uncertainty when quantifying uncertainty in the conclusion."
