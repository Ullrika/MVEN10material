## Exercise overview

Do individually

### Background

All estimates (derived from data, modelling or from experts) have associated uncertainty. This uncertainty can be described in different ways and propagated through the assessment model. 

### Purpose

- To apply interval arithmetic

- To explore the principle of 1 dimensional Monte Carlo simulation

### Content

The daily dose equation with values taken from the course book by Burgman. 

### Duration

30 minutes

### Reporting

Be prepared to report back at the end of the exercise.

### References

The course book chapter 9 and 10 (specifically 9.3.2 and 10.8.1.) 

## The daily dose equation

$$Dose = \frac{C \cdot IR \cdot EF}{bw}$$

The following estimates are provided:  

Concentration mg/l (C): 0.00063

Intake rate l/day (IR): 5

Exposure frequency unitless (EF): 0.15

Body weight mg (bw): 25.11

(@) Calculate the daily intake dose! 

## Interval artithmetic 

![](../img/burg1.png)

To consider uncertainty in estimates, we express uncertainty by intervals defined by a lower and upper bounds. 

Concentration mg/l (C): [0.000007, 0.0033]

Intake rate l/day (IR): [4,6]

Exposure frequency unitless (EF): [0.12,0.18]

Body weight mg (bw): [8.43,45.14]


(@) Calculate intervals for daily intake dose using interval arithmetic.

## 1D Monte Carlo simulation

To consider uncertainty in estimates, we express uncertainty by probability distributions defined by a distribution type and associated parameters. 

The aim is that you should be able to do this in Excel and R. 

Concentration mg/l (C): $C\sim N(0.00063,0.000063)$

Intake rate l/day (IR): $IR \sim N(5,0.5)$

Exposure frequency unitless (EF): $EF \sim U(0.12,0.18)$

Body weight mg (bw): $bw \sim N(25.11,2.51)$

Use 1D Monte Carlo simulation to

(@) approximate the expected value of the daily intake 
(@) approximate the standard deviation of the daily intake 
(@) derive an approximate 90% probability interval for daily intake
(@) the probability that the daily intake is above the thresholds for the tolerably level
