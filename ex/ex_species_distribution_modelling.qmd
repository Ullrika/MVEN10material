## Exercise overview

### Background

The use of species distribution modeling to predict the possible extent of suitable habitat for significant pests has been accepted as an efficient method for determining effective management and countermeasures. CLIMEX and MaxEnt are widely used software for creating species distribution models. CLIMEX predicts climatic suitability of a specific region for target species, whereas MaxEnt uses various environmental variables with presence-only data to assess potential distribution.
