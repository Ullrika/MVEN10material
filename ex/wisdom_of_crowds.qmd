## Quantity to be elicited

The healthy life years for females in Norway 2022

Healthy life years is defined as the number of remaining years that a person at birth is expected to live without any severe or moderate health problems. 

[Link to definition on eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/hlth_hlye_h_esms.htm)

## Procedure (1)

- We discussed the quantity and enusured that it was well-defined 

- The experts (students) made their judgements independent of each other 

- Each student fitted a distribution to their judgements and extracted a 80% probability interval 

- The judgements (five quantiles) and the probability interval was shared with the facilitator (Ullrika)

## Procedure (2)

- The facilitator uploaded the judgements into the SHELF app for multiple experts

```{r}
#| eval: false

elicitMultiple()
```

## Procedure (3)

- Judgements shown by the quartiles

## Procedure (3)

- Judgements shown as "histograms"

## Procedure (3)

- Judgements shown by the best fitting probability distribution

## The aggregated judgement - linear pool

```{r}
## add the calculated 80% prob from the linear pool - done after running the elicitMulitple app in SHELF

lb_lp = 14
ub_lp = 75
```

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(read_excel('../data/Ex5 MVEN10 (Svar).xlsx', range = "G2:I9"))
colnames(df) <- c("P10","P90","P")
rownames(df) <- LETTERS[1:nrow(df)]

```

```{r}
df$diff <- df$P90-df$P10
df$nr <- 1:nrow(df)

df2 <- data.frame(value=c(df$P10,df$P90),bound = rep(c("Lower","Upper"),each=nrow(df)),expert=rep(paste("expert",LETTERS[1:nrow(df)]),2))
df2$bound <- ordered(df2$bound,levels=c("Upper","Lower"))
```

## Individual judgements

- Judgements shown as 80% probability intervals 

```{r}
df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=expert,y=value, fill=bound))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",width=0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#6A51A3","#E7E7E7"))+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip() 
  
```

## With the aggregated judgement

- Aggregation made taking the linear pool

```{r}
df3 <- df2 %>%
  add_row(value = lb_lp, bound = "Lower", expert = "Aggregated") %>%
  add_row(value = ub_lp-lb_lp, bound = "Upper", expert = "Aggregated")
df3$bound <- ordered(df3$bound,levels=c("Upper","Lower"))

df3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=expert,y=value, fill=bound))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",width=0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#6A51A3","#E7E7E7"))+
 geom_rect(aes(ymin=lb_lp,ymax=ub_lp,xmin=0.75,xmax=1.25),colour='orange',linewidth = 1, alpha=0,inherit.aes=FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip() 
  
```

## With the true value 

- The true value taken from eurostat is 64.2 years (red line)

```{r}
df3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=expert,y=value, fill=bound))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",width=0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#6A51A3","#E7E7E7"))+
  geom_rect(aes(ymin=lb_lp,ymax=ub_lp,xmin=0.75,xmax=1.25),colour='orange',linewidth = 1, alpha=0,inherit.aes=FALSE) +
 theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 64.2, colour = "red"), linewidth = 1) +
  coord_flip() 
  
```

## Comment

- The average number of healthy years for females in Norway is likely to be below but close to the life expectancy, and unlikely to be close to 0 or above 100

- Some probability distributions allows for negative values, which is problematic when calculating the probability intervals 

- Take home message: 

  - make sure the experts understand the quantity, e.g. by asking them to justify their judgements
  
  - the final probability distribution must be chosen with care
