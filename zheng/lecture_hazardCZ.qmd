## Schedule

3-4pm: lecture on hazard characterization

4-5pm: exercise on species sensitivity distribution

---

## Dose-response assessment

### Description of hazards

_"Ice cream consumption, exposure, intervention, experiment"_

With or without a description of dose pertaining to the hazard:

- Consuming _water_ can cause death

- Consuming _1000 liters water_ can cause death

- Consuming _1000 liters water in 1 hour_ can cause death

---

### A complete description of hazard must include dose

With enough dose, everything could be lethal

"*dosis sola facit venenum*" - Paracelsus, 1538

"Only the dose makes the poison"

Hazard characterization, aka dose-response assessment:

After the **identification** of hazard, how the adverse outcome changes quantitatively in response to the changes in hazard?

## Why move away from NOAEL/LOAEL for dose-response assessment?

Example 1

_tolerated probability of type I error: 0.01_

| Dose | Response | p value  |
|------|----------|----------|
| 0    | 10.0        | \-       |
| 5    | 10.5      | 0.34     |
| 25   | 11.3      | 0.002     |
| 50   | 18.3       | \< 0.001 |

1. Can you find a NOAEL?

2. Can you find a LOAEL?

Example 2

| Dose | Response | p value |
|----|----|-----|
|0 | 10.0 | \- |
| 10 | 10.5 | 0.005 |
| 25 | 11.3 | \< 0.001 |
| 50 | 18.3 | \< 0.001 |

1. Can you find a NOAEL?

2. Can you find a LOAEL?

3. What's the difference between example 1 and 2? How the differences affect NOAEL/LOAEL?

---

### Problems of NOAEL/LOAEL approach

- Limited by dosage setup in study design

- Limited use of data

- NOAEL not always available

- No expression of uncertainty

---

## Benchmark dose modeling

### What is BMD? 

1. fit a statistical model to all dose-response data

2. Determine a BMR: a level of response of practical interest, e.g., not considerably adverse in the population

3. **Estimate the dose that causes the BMR using the fitted model**

### Strength 

1. Proper use of all dose-response data

2. Much less limited by dosage setup in study design

3. Not requiring the data to show a NOAEL

4. Allow the expression of uncertainty as distributions

### Challenges

1. Require more and complicated statistical analysis

2. Sensitive to selection of BMR

3. Sensitive to choices in statistical modeling

### Example benchmark dose models

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=F,warning=F}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Create example data for each type of dose-response curve
dose <- seq(0, 100, length.out=10)

# Monotonic increasing without threshold
response_mono_no_thresh <- 0.5 * dose + rnorm(length(dose), 0, 1)

# Monotonic increasing with threshold
threshold <- 40
response_mono_with_thresh <- ifelse(dose > threshold, 1 * (dose - threshold), 0) + rnorm(length(dose), 0, 1)

# U-shaped dose-response curve
response_u_shape <- 1 * (dose - 50)^2 / 100  + rnorm(length(dose), 0, 1)

# Create a data frame to hold the data
data <- data.frame(
  dose = rep(dose, 3),
  response = c(response_mono_no_thresh, response_mono_with_thresh, response_u_shape),
  type = rep(c("Monotonic (no threshold)", "Monotonic (with threshold)", "U-shaped"), each = length(dose))
)

# Plot the dose-response curves using ggplot2
ggplot(data, aes(x = dose, y = response, color = type)) +
  # geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Dose-Response Curves", x = "Dose", y = "Response") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "red")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Three shapes of dose-response curves")
```

1. Monotonic, threshold

Threshold: a level of **dose** beyond which the level of **responses** changes significantly

  - Most ideal shape for decision making

  - Require more data for modeling

  - Majority of chemicals: non-mutagenic, safe below threshold
  
  - BMD around the threshold

2. Monotonic, no threshold

  - Easy to model

  - Mutagenic chemicals: one molecular can cause cancer, no safe level
  
  - BMD around the dose that causes considerable risk, e.g., >= 1 cancer in 100,000 population
  
3. Non-monotonic

  - Hormesis
  
  - Essential chemicals
