## Introduction

- Risk = Hazard * Exposure

![Risk Assessment Paradigm](risk_paradigm.png){fig-align="center"}

## Hazard Identification and Characterization

Different questions of interest:

* Identification: YES/NO

* Characterization: dose-response models

## Validity: Hierarchy of Evidence

![Evidence Pyramid (Golden and Bass 2013)](Evidence_pyramid.png){fig-align="center"}

### Opinion without evidence

* **NOT** expert judgement; **Not necessarily** from experts

* Strength: useful in the lack of empirical evidence

* Weakness: low validity (not necessarily wrong!)

### Case report & case series

* Definition

* Strength: simple in design and practice

* Weakness: no account for bias; generalizability

### Observational studies

* Definition: observational vs interventional

* Type: case control, cohort

* Strength: generalizable within study groups; less bias from comparison

* Weakness: no full account for bias

### Controlled experiments (randomized and non-randomized)

* Definition: direct intervention; group assignment

* Strength: direct evaluation of impact of intervention to reduce bias

* Weakness: time-consuming, expensive, ethical challenges

### Systematic reviews

* Strength: consider existing evidence for their results, validity and generalizability; adaptive

* Weakness: complicated and affected by review methodology

## Type: Lines of Empirical Evidence

Type: human, animal (in vivo), non-animal (in vitro, new-approach methodologies)

### Human Experiments

Atrocities within sight:

* during WWI, deliberate and pseudo-scientific experiments and torture on human by Japanese and German Nazi

* Tuskegee Syphilis study (1932-1972) by US government, targeting African Americans 

### Why we don't conduct human experiments

* Ethics: "_Cannot deliberately expose humans to potentially harmful agents._"

* Potential harmful agents: observational evidence in human + controlled experiments in animal and non-animal systems

* Beneficial agents: controlled trails, voluntary participation after complete transparency



### Epidemiological studies

* Definition: Observational studies on human

* Design: prospective vs retrospective, sampling, extrapolation

* Limitations in interpretation: results from epidemiological studies should only be interpreted as associations, not causations

### Animal studies

* Species: rodents (rats, mice), fish, earthworm, dogs, monkeys, etc.

* Strength: free from human ethical concerns; precise controls; mechanistic insights

* Weakness: intra-species difference

  - More toxic to animal than human: DDT (Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, 1962)
  
  - More toxic to human than animal: arsenic ([WHO arsenic facts](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic))
  
  - Acute animal dosing for chronic human exposure
  
### Non-animal studies

* Type: in vitro (cell/tissue cultures), in silico (computational modeling/simulations)

* Example: physiologically-based artificial organ system, human cell genome analysis (omics), quantitative structure-activity relationship models

* Strength: free of animal use ([3R principles](https://ki.se/en/research/popular-science-and-dialogue/animal-research/the-principles-of-3r))- rapid, high-throughput, cost-effective, no ethical concerns

* Weakness: still developing, limited acceptance in regulation and application

## Discussion and Exercise

Separate into two groups and discussion the following questions (5 min):

1. considering the strength and weakness of each line of evidence, how they compliment each other.

2. fill in the following table: intersection between type and validity of evidence 

| Evidence type | Case report & series | Observational studies | Controlled trails | Systematic Reviews |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Human experiment | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Epidemiological studies | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Animal studies | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Non-animal studies | ... | ... | ... | ...|

## Causal inference

Central question: inference for **causality**

"_Was the hazard **caused** by the agent of interest?_"

"_Will the intervention **cause** a reduction in the hazard?_"

### Correlation is NOT Causation

Our intuitive inference are based on **correlation**.

**Example1**:   People who use more sunscreen also have higher rates of skin cancer 

**Example2**:   In the United States, the per capita crime rates are higher among people of brown and black skin color

**Example3**:   Number of people drown increases when ice cream consumption increases

Highlights:

-   **Correlation** does not imply a **causal relationship**.
-   Lack of **correlation** does not imply a lack of **causal relationship**.
-   There may be **biases** that explain the observed association.

### Threats to validity in observational and non-randomized intervention studies

1.  **Selection Bias**: When individuals self-select into treatment groups, leading to systematic differences between groups.
    -   **Example**: People who opt for an exercise program may already be healthier than those who do not.

2.  **Confounding**: A third variable affects both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased estimates.
    -   **Example**: A new teaching method might be adopted in schools that already have higher-performing students.
    
3.  **Maturation**: Changes in subjects occur naturally over time, not because of the treatment.
    -   **Example**: Children naturally improve in cognitive skills as they age, regardless of an educational intervention.

4.  **History**: External events occurring during the study may affect outcomes.
    -   **Example**: An economic crisis affecting income levels during a study of financial literacy interventions.
    
### Observational designs

**Simple Comparison**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Simple comparison data
data_simple <- data.frame(
  group = c("Exposed", "Unexposed"),
  Hazard = c(75, 60)
)

g0 <- ggplot(data_simple, aes(x = group, y = Hazard, fill = group)) +
  geom_point(stat = "identity", size = 2) +
  ggtitle("Simple Comparison Design") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Outcome") +
  xlab("Group")
print(g0)
```

Easy to implement; Comparison at one time point only.



**One-group pre-post comparison**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
# One-group pre-post data
time <- c("Pre-Exposure", "Post-Exposure")
Hazard <- c(60, 75)

data_prepost <- data.frame(time, Hazard)
# Correcting the order by converting 'time' to a factor
data_prepost$time <- factor(data_prepost$time, levels = c("Pre-Exposure", "Post-Exposure"))

ggplot(data_prepost, aes(x = time, y = Hazard)) +
  geom_line(group = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  ggtitle("One-Group Pre-Post Comparison") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Outcome") +
  xlab("Time")

```

Check for baseline difference

**Multi-group pre-post comparisons**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
# Multi-group pre-post data
time <- rep(c("Pre-Exposure", "Post-Exposure"), each = 2)
group <- factor(rep(c("Exposed", "Unexposed"), 2))
outcome <- c(65, 75, 65, 60)

data_multigroup <- data.frame(time, group, outcome)
data_multigroup$time <- factor(data_multigroup$time,levels = c("Pre-Exposure","Post-Exposure"))

ggplot(data_multigroup, aes(x = time, y = outcome, color = group, group = group)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  ggtitle("Multi-Group Pre-Post Comparison") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Outcome") +
  xlab("Time")

```

### Bradford Hill considerations

By Austin Bradford Hill 1965, causal inference in epidemiological studies.

Nine considerations:

- Strength

- Consistency

- Specificity

- Temporality: the ONLY necessary condition for causality among the nine

- Biological Gradient

- Plausibility

- Coherence

- Experiment

- Analogy

[Hall, 2024. Austin Bradford Hill's 'Environment and disease: Association or causation'.Addition.](https://research.ebsco.com/c/hrh7jr/viewer/html/4j23s2octz) 

Hill's considerations:

- Not designed as a definitive criteria, thus should not be used as one

- All Hill's considerations satisifed without causality: ice cream consumption and drowning

### Counterfacuals

Identification question: "_Was the hazard **caused** by the agent of interest?_"

Countefactual: "Would the **same individual subject** develop the same hazard, _if anything else were the same_, without exposure to the agent of interest?"

"Will hazard on the **same subject** be reduced, _if anything else were the same_, without the intervention?"

By comparing the treatment with the counterfactual,
these threats are effectively controlled.

Counterfactuals cannot remove biases,
but isolate the causal effect from biases.

### Randomized Controlled trails as approximations to counterfactuals

Challenge to counterfactuals: Current human technology has no method to observe counterfactuals.

Approximation: randomized assignment into intervention and control groups

RCT question:
"What would happen if everything is the same **between groups** except the intervention/exposed?"

Randomized controlled trails is the GOLD STANDARD of causal inference.

### Directions to Advanced Causal Inference 

Experimental design

- What is the minimal sample size required for randomization?

- What if we want to introduce magnitude of treatment into randomization?

- What if the sample needs to be stratified to represent the population?

- Empirical evaluation of observational evidence

Quasi-experimental methods (such as instrumental variable)

- What assumption underlines these methods?

- To what extent their conclusion could be generalized?
